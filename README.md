Flixel-Scroll-Factor-Test
=========================

Test project to try out the scroll factor and dragging function of FlxExtendedSprites in HaxeFlixel.

Use the arrow keys to scroll around.
Drag the coloured boxes around.
Each colour has a different scroll factor.

Note: In order to build this you will need to run the following command to get my fixed fork of the flixel-addons library; haxelib git flixel-addons-jimmydeemo https://github.com/JimmyDeemo/flixel-addons.git.
